	I have been interested in understanding what lies beyond 30, beyond my first job and the labeled path. It feels uncertain, perhaps that's alright. While I understand that life goes on the the lack of light, lack of glory, on the middle years makes it hard to see. Am I to settle in and raise the next generation for twenty years than fall off and retire at 50? I think not, it barely feels like anything has started in life why decide that sustaining is acceptable. 
	Perhaps I don't have the impulsive nature of my teens or the carefree nature of my early twenties, but I'm still someone who wants to go forth and experience life. The lack of experience can make activities interesting for a child or early adult, everything is new to them(, to us!). 
	One thing I read that shaped my view was that we can never read all the books in the library of congress in a single lifetime. So many human experiences, all recorded away in the pages yet I could never know them all. How was to understand what was important to and needed to be read? What was important to partake in? How should I spend my precious time? The only people who I could look to were adults around me. Each of them had taken many years to grow into their individual being a small morsel of their experience may be able to help my growth by leaps and bounds. Every generation should start from the shoulders of the previous generation so that they can become the giants that the next generation will stand upon. 
	The longer one has lived the more they can take the grand mysteries of the universe and appreciate them, and help those of use growing and struggling with what it means to be alive and how to live with meaning. Life has a tendency to slip by if you can't see it flowing around you. Have you ever watched the sand flow across the beach and seen the wind rustle the trees? A truly incredible number of tiny things working together make that breeze and you can't stop it from flowing by. With proper guidance you can understand what is truly happening. With no understanding of the wind is is impossible to see that the force on your hair is the same one that effect the trees and sand. The connections and difficult to decipher without a higher understanding that can only be attained through spending time with a system. 
	I enjoy playing video games and it takes around a week to understand a game’s mechanics. Nature and the mind are much higher orders of complexity, one needs to spend around seven years to gain mastery in a skill. A young adult has mastery of so little, when truly dedicated we could have masted three skills. So much of our time coming to our twenties is dedicated to learning about the world and how to contribute to it. Each skill we know is rather rudimentary. What can be learned in twenty years, can be improved in forty, mastered in sixty and perfected in eighty. Perhaps it can be taken father still in eighty. I have seen dancers in their eighties dance circles around someone at thirty. 
	It is important to build engagement with youth for if they believe in the future they will create it. Technology we have now in the palm of our hand was the dream of writers from the seventies because they engaged a generation. It is important to have a dream that must be larger than a drive for youth engagement. Every organization wants more, more eyeballs, more hours, more clicks. Thats not a true engagement, because it does not leave the consumer feeling fulfilled. If you want to build a community then people will require something with intrinsic value to them, that value will drive them to building another generation. 
	I fell out of the Jewish community because to me it was not a community I wanted to depend on with and for my life. Showing me a parlor trick  with trips and youth camps did not make me feel like I was anything more than a resource to be corralled. That did not entice me into building a Jewish family. 
	The values I learned are what I have carried with me, they told me about life and were something I wanted to apply and grow from. My favorite class was “Torah and Tires”, during which we studied tanach and learned how to fix bicycles. It  grounded the knowledge making it not just a book but a way of life, something to depend on through the traffic that found along the road. 
	As a young adult I'm told I have all the answers to life, that I should show bravado but I'm still a lost lamb searching for inner peace. Removing the generational gaps and integrating the community as a pillar of life would make that community something to turn to. Understanding how it can help people grow into a healthy adult would help drive long tail engagement. The drive to build a community is good, remember you are helping to grow minds not just in the youth.  
	Investing in the future is a cross-generational effort that can only be completed if all parties are engaged in the conversation. The compounded knowledge of the elders can be integrated into the life of today. We are still dealing with other human beingsand it takes time to understand a system that complex.
